## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv",stringsAsFactors=F)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
#activity$interval <- strptime(activity$interval,format = "%H:%M")
activity$interval <- paste(as.integer(activity$interval/100),activity$interval%%100,sep = ":")
activity$interval <- paste(activity$date,activity$interval,sep = " ")
head(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps~date,activity,sum)
hist(stepsPerDay$steps,xlab = "Total number of steps per day",breaks = nrow(stepsPerDay))
meanStepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps~date,activity,mean)
medianStepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps~date,activity,median)
meanStepsPerDay
medianStepsPerDay
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
plot(x = activity$interval,y = mean(stepsPerDay$steps,na.rm = T),type="l")
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
